####How the game is played

The game is played offline and with 3 players. Playerâ€™s turn. He chooses to auction or trade.   

######Auction:  
The player draws a card. Then the 2 other players proceed to verbally bid on the animal. Once the price is determined the player taps the SOLD button, after which the buying player and the price is inputted. The auction has now ended.  

######Trade:  
The player selects the opposite player and the animal he wants to bid for. He then taps the LETS TRADE button. Now the first player is prompted a bid. Then the second player places his bid. A pop-up menu alerts the players who has won the trade and the winning player gets the animals.  

Players need to be able to see there stats at all times. Animals (and thus score) are open; everyone can see the distribution of the animals. For the money this is a bit different. The amount of money cards is open, but the total amount is hidden. This is shown by holding down finger on money cards digit (Optional: input 3 digit password to avoid dirty play).
